# simple-linear-regression-1
This is my first linear regression model.
I worked on a dataset with two columns (hours spent and scores of student).
i built this model to predict the percentage of students that study at a number of hours.
the linear regression model had a mean absolute error of 4.183859899002982, so i'd say it is fairly good.
i hope to improve more! happy machine learing!
